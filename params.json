{"name":"NoMo-CMS","tagline":"A straight forward Nodejs and MongoDB CMS","body":"### Welcome to NoMo CMS.\r\nContrary to it's name, this doesn't encourage no more CMS' ...rather it's a simple CMS based on Nodejs and MongoDB. The intention here was to create something usable right off the shelf, which also includes a helpful bag of tricks commonly required by every project:\r\n\r\n* Basic-authentication\r\n* Mobile/useragent detection\r\n* Mongodb CRUD\r\n* Dynamic templating\r\n* Route separation\r\n* Static file serving \r\n\r\nThere are some other helpful libs baked in like angularjs, twitter bootstrap, and karma for end to end testing; however, these are easily replaced and/or removed. Feel free to clone and modify for your own purposes:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd /your_repo_name\r\n$ git clone git://github.com/martenc/nomo-cms.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nJust myself at the moment, Marten (@martenc).\r\n\r\n### Support or Contact\r\nHaving trouble with something?
